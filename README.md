**`NY Times`:** These data are used for the general NLP workflow and then processed to evaluate using `VADER` to check the feeling of the article (positive, negative or neutral). You can see that there is also a trend over a short period of time as. 



**`Indeed Job Posts`:** Parse job postings, location, state, job summary ,qulaifcations text. The qualifications portion which is used for the NLP, is the raw text from the posting. It is used in two parts: first it is compared against a list of words relating to relevant skils and generate a column in a data frame to evaluate what skills are used for each job.
